## TimingSystemRESTApi
This plugin provides a basic JSON REST api for [TimingSystem](https://github.com/Makkuusen/TimingSystem).

This plugin requires [TimingSystem](https://github.com/Makkuusen/TimingSystem) to be installed on the server, otherwise it doesn't do anything.

Files placed in the ./plugins/TimingSystemRESTApi/public_html/ folder will be served from the internal web server.       
The internal web server port can be configured by changing the `port` in `config.yml`.
